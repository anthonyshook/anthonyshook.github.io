This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This repo contains the react-app used to generate my personal [https://anthonyshook.com](https://anthonyshook.com). 
The master branch contains the deployed code.  

It's a static site, so why use react at all?  I used this primarily as a means of learning a bit 
about how react-apps are built, and to play around with web-design using SCSS / JS. I also just
wanted to finally convert my CV into something a little more modern.

## Editing the Site
While a fair chunk of the site is written directly in the .JSX files (e.g., most of the 'about me' page), 
I tried to make certain elements editable via JSON, to make it easier to add new employment records, skills,
or projects.  So, if you want to use this design, most of the changes you'd need to make are in the CV.JSON file,
and not in the JSX/HTML itself. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
